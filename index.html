             All about me
        </h1>

        <p>
            My name is Lino Pirrotta. I primarily like to do creative work in my free time (i.e art, game development, etc).<br>Other than that, I like a variety of music artists like Cynthoni and Playboi Carti and go to a lot of concerts.<br>I also like to go out and do Urbex (urban exploring) every once in a while. I also have had an interest in tech since I was 12, and have built a few PC's.
